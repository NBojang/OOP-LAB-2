# OOP-LAB-1
##Objective
The objective of the lab was to produce model a zoo using OOP(Object Oriented Programming)

The first step was creating Classes and Modules using Ruby programming language.
The pillars of OOP where covered in this lab, Encapsulation and inheritance where the mainly covered in this lab.

The classes and Modules where used to inherent different information about the zoo, since inheritance allows new objects to take on the properties of existing objects.

For this lab I had a superclass of Zoo and subclasses of animals and subclasses of birds and mammals. Encapsulation was used to build the data for the zoo to make it easily accessible and reusable.
